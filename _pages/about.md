I am a Researcher and Data Scientist with 10 years of experience in data analysis and 5 years in academic research. During my PhD, I developed strong skills in analyzing, modeling, visualizing, predicting, and validating \textit{networks} (graphs).

In addition, I am familiar with methodologies for analyzing various types of data --cross-sectional, temporal, and spatial-- which I have applied in previous roles as a data scientist and consultant for both public institutions and private companies.

Throughout my career, I have refined the ability to translate complex real-world problems into structured analytical projects. Furthermore, my experience teaching and presenting findings at conferences has contributed to communicate ideas clearly and meaningfully to different audiences. I place a strong emphasis on understanding both the capabilities and limitations of the tools I use, as well as ensuring the quality and integrity of the data I work with.

I have expertise in Python, R, and modern statistical and data science workflows.
