**Abstract:** We perform a systematic analysis of the quality of fit of the
  stochastic block model (SBM) for 275 empirical networks spanning a
  wide range of domains and orders of size magnitude. We employ
  posterior predictive model checking as a criterion to assess the
  quality of fit, which involves comparing networks generated by the
  inferred model with the empirical network, according to a set of
  network descriptors. We observe that the SBM is capable of providing
  an accurate description for the majority of networks considered, but
  falls short of saturating all modeling requirements. In particular,
  networks possessing a large diameter and slow-mixing random walks tend
  to be badly described by the SBM. However, contrary to what is often
  assumed, networks with a high abundance of triangles can be well
  described by the SBM in many cases. We demonstrate that simple network
  descriptors can be used to evaluate whether or not the SBM can provide
  a sufficiently accurate representation, potentially pointing to
  possible model extensions that can systematically improve the
  expressibility of this class of models.
