**Abstract:** We assess the performance of the stochastic block model (SBM) in
reconstructing 248 empirical networks spanning several domains and
orders of size magnitude. We simulate a noisy measurement process and
evaluate the model's ability at recovering various descriptors of the
network structure. We observe that the SBM yields accurate estimates for
most networks in the corpus, but this behaviour is not ubiquitous. In
particular, we mostly observe large reconstruction errors in networks
having large diameter and slow-mixing random walks --- corresponding
typically to networks embedded in space. Contrary to what is often
assumed, the SBM is able to provide accurate estimates on networks with
a high abundance of triangles. We also demonstrate that incorporating a
more detailed error assessment while doing measurement tends to improve
the quality of the reconstruction.
